## These are notes on devlogs I looked at that made me interested in playing their game or following their devlog thread.  I'm recording what made me feel that way so that I can try to make my own devlog that makes others feel that way:

1. A cool animated gif that shows gameplay.  I just happened to think what I saw would be a really fun game to try.  I had XP with a game that it reminded me of and I really liked.
