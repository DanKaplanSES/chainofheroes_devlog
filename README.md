# About the Game

Chain of Heroes is a combination of an Action RPG (eg: Diablo, Torchlight, etc.) and Snake (eg: Snake).  You pick up gold and inventory from killing bad guys.  Between levels you can equip your items and increase the size of your team.  There are two types of inventory items: Weapons and Skill Gems.  The weapons give you a variety of attack types and the skill gems modify your characters in interesting ways.

At this point, I think I've got the major system features in place, but there are a lot little sub features I still plan to implement.  As an example, the foundation around skill gems are in place:  You can collect them, equip them, sell them, etc. But, there are many more kinds of skill gems I want to add to the game. 

# About Me

I work full time and try to work on this as a hobby project for at least 30 minutes a day.  I've been working on this over a year at this point and it's nice to see it progress day by day.  As you can see, I'm not much of an artist and I haven't added any sound or music yet.  All the assets are placeholder art and you can find the licenses in the HTML source of the game.  **I appreciate any and all feedback. How can I make the game more fun and look better?**
  
# TODOs

1. More skill gems and weapons
1. A World Map ala Super Meat Boy
1. Better graphics
1. Sound and music
1. A concept of elements.  EG: Bad guys who are weak against fire but strong against ice.
